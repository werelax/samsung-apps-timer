* ACTIONABLES

* MISSING
** Deletions / Editions
1. Deleting (editing?) a program
2. Deleting (editing?) a timer

Both can be solved implemeting some kind of "edit mode" that shows two
action buttons below every item (and separates the items a bit so it
becomes easy to recognize which button belongs to which item).
