* ACTIONABLES
- [ ] The timer screen
- [ ] Change to the next timer of the program
- [ ] End of program screen (a info msg + just one button: [OK])
- [ ] A initial warmup screen would be good, too (like a 5s countdown)

* DEBT

- [MISSING] edit/delete the timers
- [MISSING] edit/delete the programs

- [IMPROVEMENT] show the program you're in (for the timer listing + time screen)

* MISSING
** Deletions / Editions
1. Deleting (editing?) a program
2. Deleting (editing?) a timer

Both can be solved implemeting some kind of "edit mode" that shows two
action buttons below every item (and separates the items a bit so it
becomes easy to recognize which button belongs to which item).
